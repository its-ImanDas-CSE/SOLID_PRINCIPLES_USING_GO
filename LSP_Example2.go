/* Vehicle class: This class might have a method called move(), which makes the vehicle move.
   Car class: This is a subclass of Vehicle, and it has its own version of the move() method, which might make the car move differently from a general vehicle.
   **According to LSP, if you use a Vehicle in your program and later replace it with a Car, everything should still behave as expected â€” the program should still work properly. */
